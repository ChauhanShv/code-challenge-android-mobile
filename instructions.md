# Terminal App
The terminal app allows its users to deposit and withdraw money from their bank account. If the user does not have enough money, the app prevents them to make that withdrawal.

Example: Deposit:50.00(ok), Withdraw:25.00(ok), Withdraw:25.00(ok), Withdraw:0.1(not ok)

The API to support these functions is still being worked on by backend team but should be available in the near future.   

## Your task
- You are to introduce a new feature that allows the user to view their past transactions
- Part of this task is to improve the current code which was intentionally made with poor programming practices and a few bugs
- Improvements are to be made without rewriting the app.

## Expectations
The code is quite short that one can easily refactor the entire codease in one sitting, but what we're after is the refactoring strategy to make the code better. We also don't expect the you to refactor the everything, instead, we'd like to know which for you are the most important parts to refactor and why. We expect that the repository is always at a releasable state. Thus it is important to make sure that any change does not introduce any regressions or bugs.

We understand that everybody's situation is different that's why we give candidates several days to complete the exercise. Having said that, please don't spend more than 5 hours to complete this exercise. Provide a README file to document any decisions/improvements you've deferred for later and any assumptions you have made.

### What we're looking for
- Small incremental improvements -- commit in small deliverable chunks
- A testing strategy to support the refactoring
- Simple and concise code
– Proper modelling of the domain
– A README that will help other developers

### What you will be submitting
- A zip file of the entire project including the .git folder -- the git history is an important part of this submission
- A README that details the decisions you've made. This is a good place to write which improvements you've deferred but would like to work on given more time.

## Questions?
- All questions are good questions, if you have any, please don't hesitate to send us an e-mail at jc@myzeller.com

Good luck and happy coding!
